3. In the project settings, copy:
   - Project URL â†’ `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - anon public key â†’ `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4. In this project folder, create a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`) and fill the values:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR-PROJECT.ref.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_ANON_KEY
